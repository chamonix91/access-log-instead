MYRE Software engineer test

## Intro

Those tests are meant for you to show us your skills as a software engineer. The capacity to find the perfect npm package is a great skill,
but it's not the one which is evaluated here.

- can you solve the problematic?
- can you spot all the edge cases?
- is your code scalable? (can you see beyond the task?)

## Important

You do not have to implement production-ready code, add comments to let us know you understand the limits of what you've written:

- // this won't work if ... so we could do ... in order to ...
- // this will cause performances issues if ... so we may want to ...
- // I don't know why, but I don't like that code
- // the library ... should likely do the job better than that
- // if we want to also take into account ... we probably should ...
